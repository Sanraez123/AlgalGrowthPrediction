## Colour_Intensity_with_ML
A documentation of my year 4 final MEng project.

### ***Project title***
Exploration of Machine Learning Models on Predicting Colour Intensity of Haematococcus Pluvialis.

#### ***Descriptions***
- Haematococcus Pluvialis, a type of microalgae, are currently highly focused upon due to it being a high value product and low environmental impact.
- However, much more research was required to deploy its production on larger scale due to various limitations (economics, water usage, etc.)
- Colour intensity is a method to monitor microalgae's growth, but requires specific lab machines, causing higher time and cost requirement.
- summary of all ML are documented in MLmodels_combined.pdf
                
#### ***Objectives***
1. To successfully digitalize the microalgae monitoring process.
2. To develop and improve machine learning model that can predict colour intensity based on an image taken with a smartphone.
